# Predictions for the German Bank Credit Data using Naive Bayes
This project involves using a Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model and a Gaussian Naive Bayes Model to make predictions for the German Bank Credit Data. The prepared data has gone through several preprocessing steps including cleaning missing values, aggregating categories of certain categorical variables, encoding categorical variables as binary dummy variables, and standardizing numeric variables.

The focus of this project is solely on building the models and comparing their performance. The goal is to determine which model, between the Bernoulli Naive Bayes and Gaussian Naive Bayes, provides the best predictions for the German Bank Credit Data.

## Data
The German Bank Credit Data has been preprocessed and is ready for use in the models. The data includes information on credit applications, including credit history, purpose of loan, savings, employment, and personal status.

## Models
The Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model and Gaussian Naive Bayes Model will be used to predict whether a credit application will be approved or denied. The performance of each model will be compared to determine which provides the best predictions for this dataset.

## Results
The results of the model predictions will be analyzed to determine the accuracy of each model in predicting credit approval or denial for the German Bank Credit Data. The comparison of the two models will provide insights into which model may be more effective in predicting credit approval or denial for this dataset.

## Conclusion
This project aims to compare the performance of a Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model and a Gaussian Naive Bayes Model in predicting credit approval or denial for the German Bank Credit Data. By analyzing the results of each model, we can gain insights into which model may be more effective for this dataset.
