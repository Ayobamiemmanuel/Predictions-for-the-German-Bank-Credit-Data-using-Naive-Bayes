# Predictions-for-the-German-Bank-Credit-Data-using-Naive-Bayes
Use a Bernoulli Naive Bayes Model to make predictions for the German Bank Credit Data. Use a Gaussian Naive Bayes to also make predictions and compare the performance of the two models.

You will use the prepared data which has gone through the the following preprocessing:

Cleaning missing values.
Aggregating categories of certain categorical variables.
Encoding categorical variables as binary dummy variables.
Standardizing numeric variables.
Focus on just building the model
